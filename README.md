Consider this studying for the FRQ portion of your final. Create a new codespace(May have to reinstall extensions) or copy and paste them into one of your old codespace.

//This may cover Classes, Arrays, ArrayList, and Math.random

~~Part 1: create a class called Drink with the proper attributes, getter/setters, and methods. Once this is done you can move onto part 2~~


~~Part 2: go to your main and create your drink objects and place them in an array and what not.~~

~~Part 3: Complete the methods in the Main class that involve the arrays.~~

CANNOT BE COMPLETED until PART 1 is done properly

Part 4: Examine the VenMachine Class. Complete the comments in each line and answer the questions in the comments.
        You should understand what the ranges of the Math.random do
        
 Then go back to your Main.java and uncomment the line of code that will create your VenMachine Object.

 See if that helps you with indentifying what the class does.

Finally complete the other methods in the VenMachine Class and test them in the Main.
